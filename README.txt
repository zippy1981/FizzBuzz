I wrote this FizzBuzz solution in just under 5 minutes as per a web egg timer. Visual Studio was open before the timer started, but I had to go all "File|New Project" etc. Also, Windows 7 backup was running in the background and some keys on my laptop keyboard were stuck due to rice.

After the fact editing: There was some minor cleanup after the fact with ReSharper and I originally mispelled spelled Fizz as FIxx. I also added this comment.
 
This was a simple exercise I engaged in just to prove to myself I could do FizzBuzz.
